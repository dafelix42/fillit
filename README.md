# fillit
An algorithm to find the minimum square which is able to store all the tetris pieces

# Goal
Fillit does not consist of recoding Tetris, even if itâ€™s still a variant of this game.
Your program will take a file as parameter which contains a list of Tetriminos and
arrange them to create the smallest square possible. Obviously, your main goal is to
find this smallest square in the minimal amount of time, despite a exponentially growing
number of possibilities each time a piece is added.
Then, you will have to think carefully about your data structures and your solving
algorithm, if you want your program answers before the next millenium.

# Group project
This was the first group project of our cursus.
We were 2 persons and we split the work at the beginning.
My teammate had the responsability to parse the file and make sure it was a valid one.
I had the responsability of creating the algorithm to arrange the tetriminos and make it fit in the smallest square possible.
We established which values he should store, values that i needed for my part.
It was a great team experience!
